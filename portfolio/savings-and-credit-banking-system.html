                        <h3>What is the project about?</h3>
                        <p>A Savings and Credit Cooperative (SACCO) or Savings and Credit Banking System is a financial institution that aims to promote savings among its members and provide them with access to credit facilities. These cooperative societies are member-owned and operated, often serving specific communities or groups with a shared common bond, such as employees of a particular organization, residents of a specific locality, or individuals with a common profession or interest.</p>
                        <p>This system offers a range of financial services to its members, including savings accounts, fixed deposits, loans, and other financial products. Members pool their savings, which are then used to provide affordable credit facilities to fellow members. By doing so, this system helps members access credit at reasonable interest rates, especially when traditional banking services may be inaccessible or cost-prohibitive.</p>
                        <p>In addition to financial services, this system often provides financial education and support to its members, promoting financial literacy and responsible money management practices. They operate on the principle of mutual assistance and cooperative economics, to improve the financial well-being of their members and the community they serve.</p>
                        <p>This system is regulated and supervised by relevant governmental authorities to ensure compliance with financial regulations and to protect the interests of members. Their structure and operation may vary from country to country, but the core principles of promoting savings, providing credit, and fostering financial inclusion remain central to their mission.</p>
